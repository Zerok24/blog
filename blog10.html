    <h1>Blog 10</h1>
    <h2>CodeMirror</h2>

    <p>
        Inspire the book for this class, I wanted to start a personal project in which I need 
        a online code editor for my website. After google around for many hours I came around an open source project
        called CodeMirror. CodeMirror makes it super easy to make a browser code editor for JavaScript. It is also 
        super customizeable. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Just download the project from <a href="https://codemirror.net/">here</a>, and then add the following lines of code:
    </p>

    <p>
        The easiest way to use CodeMirror is to simply load the script and style sheet found under
        lib/ in the distribution, plus a mode script from one of the mode/ directories. For example:
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="/codemirror1.PNG" alt="basic usage">
    </p>

    <p>
        Then you create a text area in you HTML. After that in your script you do the following: 
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="/codemirror2.PNG" alt="script codemirror">
    </p>

    <textarea id="code">console.log("Hello, World!");</textarea>

    <p>It is that easy!</p>

    <p>
        Though this is already very helpful for whatever you want to do, you might want to add 
        more customization like sintax highlighting or add a theme this can easily be done with  the 
        following lines of code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Link the stylesheet in the "theme" forder inside codemirror.
        <p>

            <img src="/codemirror4.PNG" alt="">
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/codemirror3.PNG" alt="">
    </p>
    
    <textarea id="code2" >console.log("Hello, World!");
//Your code goes here
    </textarea>


    <p>
        The customization is ultimited. There are plenty of themes to choose from, over 100
        programming languages, and since it is and open source project, you can add things if 
        you like to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Check out CodeMirror <a href="https://codemirror.net/">website</a> to see all you can do.
    </p>

    editor.setSize(300,200);

    const editor2 = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById("code2"),{
        lineNumbers: true,
        mode: "javascript",
