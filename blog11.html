    <p>
        This class has been an amazin experience. I was able to learn so much and work on projects
        I care about. I was able to learn thing that helped me land a good job. So Thanks 
        Professor Johnson!
    </p>

    <p>Here are a couple of suggestions to make this class even better: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Split the class into 2: Though we were able to learn a great deal, I would have like 
            to master even more the content and maybe expand on other topics like templete
            engines.
        </li>

        <li>
            The book has been a great. Often is easy to follow but there were instances in which 
            I would have like the source code of the projects the we were working on the book
            in case we get lost. THIS WOULD BE AMAZING!!! SOURCE CODE PLEASE!!!!
        </li>
        <li>
            I would have love if would have a section in the book fully dedicated to the 
            cloud services we were using. The hardest part of the class and the one the cause
            hardest problem were cloud releted problems.
        </li>
        <li>
            Maybe use AWS for cloud services instead of digital ocean. I know that Amazon is a 
            big evil corporation, but wfor job related porpuses AWS looks nicer in the resume.
        </li>
        <li>
            Teach Postman for API purposes.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        Thanks Professor Johnson for all your hard work, dedication and willingness to help.
        You did an AMAZING job.
