    <h2>The Power of HTML</h2>

    <p>
        HTML is more powerful than I thought. This week I learned about the input tag and its type attribute.
        It turns out the the input tag along with the type attribute are very powerful! with HTML you can colect
        all sorts of inputs. Here is a classic example:
    </p>

    <div>
        <input type="month" id="start" name="start"
           min="2018-03" value="2018-05">
    </div>

    <p>
        wait, there are many more... are you familiar with any of this?
    </p>

    <div>
        <label for="favcolor">Color selector</label>
        <input type="color" id="favcolor" name="favcolor">
    </div>

    <div>
        <label for="week">Week Seletor</label>

        <input type="week" name="week" id="camp-week"
            min="2018-W18" max="2018-W26" required>
    </div>

    <div>
        <label for="date">Date Selector</label>

        <input type="date" name="date" id="camp-week"
       min="2018-W18" max="2018-W26" required>
    </div>

    <p>Even a file chooser!</p>

    <label for="avatar">Choose a profile picture:</label>

    <input type="file"
        id="avatar" name="avatar"
        accept="image/png, image/jpeg">


    <p>
        Though this might not be as cool for you, for me it is because I really believe that all of this examples
        Id given where done through a combination of CSS and Javascript or Bootstrap. I found out about this
        awesome HTML feature through W3schools.com.
    </p>

    <p>
        This feature makes developers life easier. They can nicely collect the data and make something with it, 
        like put it in a database. I definitly see myselft utilizing this HTML tag in the near future for 
        projects and labs.
