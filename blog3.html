    <p>
        5 years a go, when I had hair and did not know how to code, I spent a significant amount of time 
        trying to learn how to do animations. I downloaded Abode Flash and started to learn the basics of 
        animation. After learning the basics and played with the basic default pre-made shapes from the 
        program, I thought I was ready for the next level. Animate my own drawings. I first tried to make 
        my drawings with the  computer mouse. After countless failings and numerous curses to my mouse, I
        decided to buy a graphic tablet so my drawings would "improve". After spending $70, and cursing 
        my graphic tablet, I came to the realization that I suck at drawing and animating.

        Today I have learned that I wasted time and money trying to make animations out my own drawings.
        There is a much easy way to do it. I just needed to learned CSS. Yes! animations can be done with
        CSS. CSS is capable to do very complex and interesting animations. From color changes to complex 
        movements. With CSS, you can really do pretty much anything if you have creativity. With CSS you
        can custimize keyframes, animation delay, duration, specify how many time you want an action to 
        repeat, specify directions and much more.
