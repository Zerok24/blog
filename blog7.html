    <h2>React: Function vs Class components</h2>

    <p>
        Encounrage By the professor, Chris Johnson, to learn something new about React, 
        this week I learn something about the react syntax. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from all the cool stuff that React unlocks for those who learn this framework, like
        react native, hooks, nextjs, etc, React also gives flexibility in the syntax. You have 2 
        options to choose from, Class components vs Function components
    </p>

    <p>
        Class component would look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
        import React from "react";

            class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
                render() {
                    return &#60;h1&#62;Hello, world&#60;/div&#62;;
                }
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        A function component would look something like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
        import React from "react";

        function FunctionalComponent() {
            return &#60;h1&#62;Hello, world&#60;/div&#62;;
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        So basically is just 2 different way to write the same think, but function components are 
        being prefered more and more because is easier to read and it reduces code lines.
