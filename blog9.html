    <h2>strict mode</h2>

    <p>
        As someone that started coding with Java, JavaScript is something hard to find errors.
        JavaScript is a dynamic type language and the JavaScript compiler is very forgiving about
        bad syntax. For example, the following code will not compile in an error:
    </p>

    <pre>
        1)
        x = 85.9;


        2)
        function hello(r1,r1){
            //...
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        These kind of things can cause pain when trying to figure out why the code is not working.
        That why on ECMAScript version 5, the "use strict" mode was release as a way to secure
        our code from this bad syntax.

        The  following examples, would have not been resulted in error but because of "use strict"
        we are able to catch this errors on time.
    </p>

    <h1>Examples</h1>

    <pre>
        "use strict";
        h = 78.6;                // This will cause an error
    </pre>
    
    <pre>
        "use strict";
        p = {p1:10, p2:20};     
    </pre>

    <pre>
        "use strict";
        function t(p1, p2) {};      //Deleting a function is not allowed.
        delete x;  
    </pre>

    <pre>
        "use strict";
        let eval = 3.14;
    </pre>


    <p>
        Using strict mode is becoming a convention so you should always try to use strict mode
        to prevent errors.
